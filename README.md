# EdGAIL

This is a working repository on a reinforcement learning approach to generating synthetic learning behavior data.

## EdNet

[EdNet](https://github.com/riiid/ednet) is the dataset of all student-system interactions collected over 2 years by Santa, a multi-platform AI tutoring service with more than 780K users in Korea available through Android, iOS and web.

The goal is to use EdNet to extract an expert policy that will be used to train an [imitation learning agent](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3054912). This agent will then model student behavior and learning habits that can be used to expand on the EdNet dataset more efficiently than by using conventional methods.
